### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lautaro! -  Software Developer, with a passion for technology and learning. Always inspired by new idea, and willingness to contribute towards a valuable end product is what pushes me. I got introduced to programming in 2019 standard when I opted for computer science as my future career because I love this industry. I got in touch with newer and more modern technologies like Artifial Intelligence, Cloud, Machine Learning, Web-Development and I just fell in love with programming, after that is still the challenges that get me going.
